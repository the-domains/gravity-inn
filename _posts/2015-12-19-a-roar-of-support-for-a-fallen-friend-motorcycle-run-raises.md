description: 'A huge herd of motorcycles flooded the 300 block of Adams Avenue in Scranton before rumbling to life Sunday, a roar of support for a fallen friend. Nearly 200 riders turned up for the First Annual Loyalty Barbershop Motorcycle Run for Scranton Police Officer John Wilding, 29, who died in the line of duty last month helping apprehend robbery suspects.'
